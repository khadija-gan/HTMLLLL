            <div>
                <h3>The debute: in 2013</h3>
                <p>On June 12, 2013, Jungkook made his debut as a member of BTS with the release of the single 2 Cool 4 Skool. Under BTS, he has sung three solo songs. The first, a pop track titled "Begin", from the 2016 album Wings, tells his story of moving to Seoul at a young age to become an idol and expresses his gratitude towards his bandmates for taking care of him during that time. The second, a future bass song titled "Euphoria", was released with an accompanying nine-minute short film on April 5, 2018, as the introduction to the third part of BTS' "Love Yourself" series. Produced by DJ Swivel, the song charted at number five on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100. Its full studio version was included on BTS' Love Yourself: Answer compilation album, released on August 24. The third solo, "My Time", off the band's 2020 studio album Map of the Soul: 7, is an R&B song about forgoing teenage experiences because of his career and charted at number 84 on the US Billboard Hot 100. "Euphoria" and "My Time" are the first and second longest-charting solo tracks among K-pop singers on the Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart, having spent a record 90 and 85 weeks respectively on the ranking. </br> BTS's first song is the lead single that BTS debuted with in 2013. It was received with strong impressions within the k-pop industry, for it’s honest and motivational lyrics, and it’s authenticity (compared to other k-pop songs at the time).

                </br>The self-penned song, along with its strong hip-hop beat, criticized the lack of passion in young people, and their lack of dreams. It reminisces ‘90s rap songs, remade with a contemporary style. </p>
